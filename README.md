# parkingProject
This is my java parking project. There are 3 different types of users, customers, officers, and admins. Customers can book up to 3 parking spots at a time and remove them.
Officers can remove any parking spot not in use by a customer. Admins can add and remove officers from the system. All users must register and login to use the system.
