# parkingProject
This is my java parking project. There are 3 different types of users, customers, officers, and admins. Customers can book up to 3 parking spots at a time and remove them.
Officers can remove any parking spot not in use by a customer. Admins can add and remove officers from the system. All users must register and login to use the system.
Pictures showcasing the program have been attached. 

"customer.png" shows customer registration while booking parking spot A1,A3,D1

"officer.png" shows officers available parking spots to be put on hold. As stated, officers can only put spots on hold which are NOT in use. We see that spot A1,A3,D1 are missing from the officers list since they are in use. Officer then puts A2,E1,E2 spot on hold so it becomes unavailable to all customers.

"admin.png" shows the current officer list testOfficer1, and testOfficer2 which are users who are registered in the system. The admin then adds an additional officer "newOfficer@gmail..com" into the system.
